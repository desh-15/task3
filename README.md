What I Did:
1.First, I uploaded a housing dataset with features like bedroom, Area, and the target variable Price.
2.I split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
3.Then I trained two models:
       Simple Linear Regression using just area vs price.
       Multiple Linear Regression using all columns.
4.I evaluated both models using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score to see how well they performed.
5.I also plotted the regression line for the simple model to visualize the fit.
6.Finally, I printed out the coefficients and intercepts to interpret the impact of each feature.
